# Contributing to Socialbug

Thank you for considering contributing to Socialbug!

## Branching Strategy

- The `main` branch contains stable code.
- For new work, create a feature branch from `main` and submit a pull request back to `main`.
- Keep your branch focused on a single feature or fix.

## Workflow

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`.
3. Make your changes and add tests or documentation as needed.
4. Ensure `docker compose config` runs without errors.
5. Commit your changes using clear commit messages.
6. Open a pull request describing your changes.
